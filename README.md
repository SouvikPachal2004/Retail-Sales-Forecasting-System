# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting

This project aims to forecast weekly sales for Walmart stores using historical data and economic indicators. It applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict future sales based on past trends, holidays, and regional statistics.

---

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. It includes information such as:

- Store: Store number
- Date: Week ending date
- Weekly_Sales: Sales for the given store on the given date
- Holiday_Flag: Whether the week includes a public holiday (1) or not (0)
- Temperature: Temperature in the region
- Fuel_Price: Cost of fuel in the region
- CPI: Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment: Unemployment rate

Dataset Source: Provided by the user (Walmart_Sales.csv)

## 🧰 Technologies & Libraries

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn (RandomForestRegressor)
- joblib (for saving the model)

---

## 📈 Workflow

1. Data Loading & Cleaning
2. Feature Engineering (Date components, Holiday flag)
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Sales trends over time and by store)
4. Model Training (Random Forest Regressor)
5. Evaluation (RMSE, MAE)
6. Visualization of actual vs predicted sales
7. Optional: Save model for future use

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric | Value     |
|--------|-----------|
| RMSE   | 558533.16 |
| MAE    | 436018.10 |

(Replace with actual results after model evaluation)

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations

- Line plot of sales trends by store
- Actual vs. Predicted Sales Plot

---

## 💾 Output

- Trained model: walmart_sales_forecast.pkl
- Notebook or script with model code

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Use Facebook Prophet or XGBoost for better time series modeling
- Add more economic/holiday-specific features
- Build a Streamlit dashboard for interactive forecasting
